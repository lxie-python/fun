Ensemble Learning: building multiple models and combine them in a way that can produce better results
When we build a model using ensemble learning, the individual models need to exhibit some diversity.
This diversity is achieved by using different training parameters for each individual model.
This allows the individual models to generate different decision boundaries for training data.
This would allow them to capture various nuances in our data.
